### **üìò Description**
Just More Cakes makes improvements to the default Minecraft cake and introduces several new mechanics and, most importantly,

Abilities range from healing to preventing detection from a sculk sensor, and many of them can be configured using a datapack.

To obtain the new cakes, there is a new furnace type called the Cake Oven. Additionally,
there is a new villager profession available that will buy and sell ingredients and, but also cake.
